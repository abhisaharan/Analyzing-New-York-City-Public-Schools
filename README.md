Analyzing New York Public Schools Data
Explored the relationship between SAT scores and demographic factors in New York City public schools. Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test given to graduating high schoolers in the United States every year. The SAT has 3 sections, each of them worth 800 points. New York City has published data on the SAT scores of students, along with additional demographic datasets.

New York City has a significant immigrant population, and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to figure out if the SAT is a fair test. If certain racial groups consistently performed better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair, for example.

These datasets are combined, cleaned into a single Pandas Dataframe:

-> SAT scores by school -- SAT scores for each high school in New York City./n

-> School attendance -- attendance information on every school in NYC.
-> Class size -- class size information for each school in NYC.
-> AP test results -- Advanced Placement exam results for each high school. Passing AP exams can get you college credit in the US.
-> Graduation outcomes -- percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.
-> Demographics -- demographic information for each school.
-> School survey -- surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school
